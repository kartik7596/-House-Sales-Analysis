# 🚗 Real Estate Price Prediction - Data Analysis with Python

# 📌 Project Overview
This project is a hands-on course where I applied data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict real estate prices in King County, USA. The goal was to analyze the features of real estate data, build regression models, and evaluate their performance. By the end of the project, I successfully learned how to predict house prices based on property details such as size, number of rooms, and location.

# 🔍 Key Learning Objectives

Data Collection: Import and clean the dataset for analysis.

Data Preparation: Handle missing values, outliers, and transform categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and summarize data to uncover patterns and correlations.

Building Regression Models: Develop linear, multiple, and polynomial regression models to predict house prices.

Model Refinement: Fine-tune models using hyperparameters and feature selection.

Pipeline Creation: Automate the workflow with Scikit-learn for efficient model training and evaluation.

# 📂 Project Structure

data/ → Raw and processed datasets related to house sales.

notebooks/ → Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, cleaning, and modeling.

src/ → Python scripts for data manipulation, model development, and evaluation.

reports/ → Visualizations and analysis reports summarizing key insights.

# 🚀 Technologies Used

Python (3.x)

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SciPy

Tools: Jupyter Notebook

# 📊 Outcome

By the end of this project, I built a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on features like property size, number of rooms, and location. The model was evaluated based on metrics such as R² and RMSE, and was optimized for accuracy to predict real estate prices efficiently.
