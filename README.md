# Data Analysis with Python: Real Estate Price Prediction

This project is a comprehensive hands-on course where I applied the fundamentals of data analysis and machine learning using Python. The aim of the project was to teach key concepts like data collection, cleaning, manipulation, visualization, building regression models, and evaluating those models. By the end of this project, I successfully gained the skills to analyze real estate data and predict house prices.

# Overview

In this project, I worked with Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to manipulate and analyze data. The core of the project was applying machine learning techniques, specifically regression models, to predict real estate prices.

The dataset used in this project contains information on house sales in King County, USA. The features of the dataset include details like property size, the number of rooms, and location, which were used to predict the house prices.

# Project: Predicting House Prices in King County, USA
In this project, I applied data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict house prices in King County, USA. The dataset contains detailed information about house sales, including features such as property size, number of rooms, and location.

The project covered the following steps and topics:

Collecting and Importing Data: I started by importing the dataset into Python from various sources, ensuring the data was ready for analysis.
Cleaning, Preparing, and Formatting Data: I handled missing values, detected outliers, and transformed categorical variables into numerical formats. This was necessary for preparing the data for machine learning models.
Data Frame Manipulation: Using Pandas, I efficiently filtered, grouped, and aggregated the data to derive useful insights and feature variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I visualized and summarized the dataset to identify key trends, correlations, and patterns between various features and house prices.
Building Machine Learning Regression Models: I developed multiple regression models, including linear, multiple, and polynomial regression, to predict house prices.
Model Refinement: I fine-tuned the models by adjusting hyperparameters and performing feature selection to improve accuracy. I evaluated the models using metrics like RÂ² and RMSE.
Creating Data Pipelines: Using scikit-learn, I streamlined the workflow by creating automated data pipelines to handle repetitive tasks such as data preprocessing and model training.
By the end of the project, I built a model that predicted house prices based on property features. The final model was chosen based on performance metrics, and it was used to make predictions for house sales in King County, USA.
