# Data Analysis with Python: Real Estate Price Prediction

This project is a comprehensive hands-on course where I applied the fundamentals of data analysis and machine learning using Python. The aim of the project was to teach key concepts like data collection, cleaning, manipulation, visualization, building regression models, and evaluating those models. By the end of this project, I successfully gained the skills to analyze real estate data and predict house prices.

# Overview

In this project, I worked with Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to manipulate and analyze data. The core of the project was applying machine learning techniques, specifically regression models, to predict real estate prices.

The dataset used in this project contains information on house sales in King County, USA. The features of the dataset include details like property size, the number of rooms, and location, which were used to predict the house prices.

# Topics Covered

The project covers the following topics:

Collecting and Importing Data: I learned how to bring data into Python from various sources.
Cleaning, Preparing, and Formatting Data: Handling missing values, detecting outliers, and formatting the data for analysis.
Data Frame Manipulation: Using Pandas to filter, group, and aggregate data efficiently.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I visualized and summarized the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
Building Machine Learning Regression Models: I developed linear, multiple, and polynomial regression models to predict house prices.
Model Refinement: I worked on improving model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters and selecting the best features.
Creating Data Pipelines: Using scikit-learn pipelines, I automated repetitive tasks to streamline the workflow.

# Predicting House Prices in King County, USA
The final project was based on a real-world scenario where I predicted the market prices of house sales in King County, USA. The dataset included detailed information about each property, such as its size, number of rooms, and location. My task was to analyze the data and build predictive models.

I followed these steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I began by analyzing the dataset to identify trends, correlations, and potential features for the models.
Data Preprocessing: I cleaned the data by handling missing values, outliers, and transforming categorical variables for model readiness.
Model Building and Evaluation: I created linear, multiple, and polynomial regression models using scikit-learn. Then, I evaluated the models using metrics such as RÂ² and RMSE.
Final Prediction: After refining the models, I made predictions on house prices in King County using the best-performing model.
