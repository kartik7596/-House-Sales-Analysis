# Data Analysis with Python: Real Estate Price Prediction

This project is a hands-on course aimed at teaching the fundamentals of data analysis and machine learning with Python. The project covers essential topics such as data collection, cleaning, manipulation, visualization, building regression models, and evaluating those models. By the end of the course, you'll have the skills to analyze real estate data and predict house prices.


Overview
In this project, you will work with Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to manipulate and analyze data. You'll explore key concepts in machine learning, including building and evaluating regression models.

The final project involves analyzing and predicting market prices of house sales in King County, USA, based on property features like size, number of rooms, and location. This project will help you apply your knowledge in a real-world data scenario.


The Project covers the following topics:

Collecting and Importing Data: Learn how to bring data into Python from different sources.
Cleaning, Preparing, and Formatting Data: Handle missing values, outliers, and format data for analysis.
Data Frame Manipulation: Use Pandas to filter, group, and aggregate data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and summarize data to uncover patterns.
Building Machine Learning Regression Models: Develop linear, multiple, and polynomial regression models.
Model Refinement: Improve model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters and selecting the right features.
Creating Data Pipelines: Automate repetitive tasks using scikit-learn pipelines.
