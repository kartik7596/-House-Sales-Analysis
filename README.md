Overview
In this course, you will work with Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to manipulate and analyze data. You'll explore key concepts in machine learning, including building and evaluating regression models.

The final project involves analyzing and predicting market prices of house sales in King County, USA, based on property features like size, number of rooms, and location. This project will help you apply your knowledge in a real-world data scenario.

Topics Covered
The Project covers the following topics:

Collecting and Importing Data: Learn how to bring data into Python from different sources.
Cleaning, Preparing, and Formatting Data: Handle missing values, outliers, and format data for analysis.
Data Frame Manipulation: Use Pandas to filter, group, and aggregate data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and summarize data to uncover patterns.
Building Machine Learning Regression Models: Develop linear, multiple, and polynomial regression models.
Model Refinement: Improve model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters and selecting the right features.
Creating Data Pipelines: Automate repetitive tasks using scikit-learn pipelines.

Final Project
Predicting House Prices in King County, USA
In this project, you will use a dataset containing detailed information about house sales in King County, USA, including property features such as size, bedrooms, and location. Your task is to analyze the data and predict house prices based on these features. You will:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.
Build and evaluate regression models to predict house prices.
Present your findings and model results.
You will find the dataset for this project in the data/ folder.
